                    <li>The interview process of Accolite had 4 rounds: 1)Aptitude 2)Coding 3)Technical 4)HR</li>
                    <li>Aptitude: The test was taken on Eduthrill platform ( 90 questions 60 min ). Questions were a mix of technical, general aptitude, verbal, and reasoning.</li>
                    <li>Coding: The round contained a question that was based on Dynamic Programming. We also had to write test cases for the same</li>
                    <li>Technical: The interviewer was friendly but was trying to trap me at every question. I gave my introduction and he asked my favorite subject from engineering to which I replied HCI, not having much knowledge of the same he repeated the question and I replied SEPM. Again not having much knowledge of the domain he asked me the questions on DBMS asked me my introduction again! After hearing my answer he was impressed and talked with me in a very soft and impressed tone for a long time (1.15 hours approx.)</li>
                    <li>HR: The interview scheduled at 3:00 pm happened around 4:30 pm and the interviewer seemed tired and uninterested. He explained to me about the company and usual terms and conditions. The interview lasted for about 15 min only.</li>

                    <span class="adv">Advice</span> 
                    <li>There are 2 types of people that come for engineering. 1) Who comes for Jobs 2) Who wants to build something.</li>
                    <li>But for both, you need to be an all-rounder! In the first year focus on your studies and try to participate in events (irrespective of winning chances). In your second year get membership in various clubs to increase your friend circle and build a network of seniors and like-minded people. </li>
                    <li>Choose a domain that you want to build a careerinandstartexploringthetechnologiesinvolved. Hopefully,inyourthirdyear,you‚Äôllgetagoodposition within the club based on your merit. </li>
                    <li>This will help you a lot with your CVs. Start preparing for placements. Build your CV, a LinkedIn profile (Github, programming profile for CS/IT pursuing students). Practice aptitude and take sudo interviews amongst yourselves. 4th year will bear fruit of your hard work.</li>
                    <li>This time around get placed early and plan multiple trips with friends and enjoy heartily! Learn to engineer your career and happiness. Just remember ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more to engineering than engineering subjects‚Äù.</li>
