                    <p>Upraised's recruitment process was a troop of 5 Interview rounds out of which, two more inclined towards the Personal aspect and Cultural perspective, and rest 3 were the highly based on Technical aspect.Â </p>
                    <p>Talking about the technical rounds, in brief, the 1st technical round went for around 2hrs. It started with my introduction, followed by chit-chatting about my projects. Later there was a DSA section, where I have been given 3 DSA problems to solve, problems were ranged between easy, easy, and medium. Following that was the Django(Backend) section, where I have been given a real-life scenario dealing with a couple of API calls, and I was to find an optimal way to call these APIs keeping few things in mind like APIs asynchronous behavior, request failures, sequence, and timeout conditions. </p>
                    <p>The last section was on React(Frontend - my favorite) it was a fun round, where I was given a random API, and I had to destructure it and render it to UI in a neat manner. That was all about the 1st Technical Round. The 2nd Technical round was more targeted towards the Frontend part, where I was asked about various CSS properties, HTML tags, and JS functions. Also, I was told to explain some code parts from my project. The 3rd technical round was based on CSS layouts, Bootstrap, and DOM manipulation. Also, there were some questions about the Product. That's all about my interview process.</p>

                    <li>Try to connect with everyone and ask .ask.ask. Get in touch with seniors, because they will assist you a lot. From projects to domain selection they'll guide you in the best way.</li>
                    <li>Don't be a Jack of all trades and master of none. I would suggest not do too multiple things at a time. Make small milestones, evaluate them on basis of your progress and declines, and plan the next steps accordingly.Â </li>
                    <li> Sharing Knowledge is one of the best things to do. Help everyone whosoever comes your way. Anytime.</li>
