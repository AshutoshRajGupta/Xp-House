            <p>For Emerson, the entire recruitment process involved an aptitude test, then a Technical interview and at the end a HR interview. The aptitude test consisted of basic general aptitude, english and basic instrumentation and measurement questions. Though we didnâ€™t see any filtering based on the aptitude test, it probably did have a take in marking every individual.</p>
            <p>The technical interview was more of a rapid fire question oriented discussion over various problems faced in Process Automation and how to solve or act on them. In my interview we hardly discussed any of my personal projects, rather the interviewer was keen on knowing my views on various scenarios that Emerson (or any other Process System based company) tend to face in a more frequent manner.</p>
            <p>I believe in that discussion itself, the interviewer was able to judge my general takes on problem solving as well as the knowledge that I have acquired during engineering in college. The HR round was a normal need to know basis questionnaire from their side.</p>
            <ul class="advice">
                <span class="adv">Advice</span>
                <li>Make a plan, donâ€™t put every decision upon time. A well structured plan is better than aiming for goals in the dark. </li>
                <li>Work to open up multiple options at the end of your engineering, depending solely on one goal might lead you to adjust with a few things or more. </li>
                <li>Read more about the industry you want to work in. Donâ€™t fixate only upon studies, join clubs and have fun. </li>
                <li>Working in clubs helps you realise what your non-Technical skills are and also in which areas you lack. Both in Technical and HR interview, the interviewer is drafting a profile of you - which involves both technical and non-technical aspects.</li>
