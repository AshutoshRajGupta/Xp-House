                    <p>There were 2 round including one online test on firstnaukri platform followed by a technical+ knowledge screening interview.</p>
                    <p>The Online test that I mentioned was 3 hour long aptitude + MCQ questions of Aptitude, DBMS, reasoning, SQL, DSA and OOPS. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The Online interview was on teams and of 1.5 hours in afternoon session. There were 3 interviewers. Tested my softskills initially and started with technical part. As my Role was selected as QA => Mostly the questions asked were related to Devops.
                     </p>
                    <p>To be honest it was like a rapidfire round for almost 30-40 mins. I was asked all the questions related to oops and all questions were chaining to whatever I answer the previous Question. (To know the depth of subject)
                    I was given 2-3 DSA questions mainly on linkedlists and algorithms.  2 DBMS queries and then OOPS questions.
                </p>
                    <p>It was a very simple interview as it was of internship only.
