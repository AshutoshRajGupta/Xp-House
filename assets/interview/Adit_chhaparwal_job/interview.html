                    <p>For Crest Data Systems, recruitment process consisted of 3 main rounds, for the first round there was a Technical Aptitude based test , next was Technical Interview  and then the final round was HR interview.
                    Technical test comprised of coding, logical and seven debugging questions which were to be solved in the given time. In addition to this, there were three programming questions , one of intermediate level and two difficult level. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Starting with the Technical interview first, the technical interview lasted for 1hour, my interview started with brief introduction about myself, following which the interviewers had a look at my resume, my mentioned skills and projects. The interviewers asked me to demonstrate my projects and then I was questioned about the project. Next I was asked to select a preferred programming language to which my selection was C++ and given three coding questions. The first question was based on recursion , second and third questions were based on hash table. According to me , through this their main aim was to analyse  the problem solving ability and  logic building of the candidate.
                    After the coding questions, there were questions on OOPS concept, Database queries , Database, Oracle and some HOT questions from Javascript. 
                     </p>
                    <p>Talking about the HR interview, here again I was asked to give a brief introduction about myself following which I was asked some situation based questions , questions regarding my weakness and strengths , some company related info. 
                    There main aim here was to check the candidateâ€™s thinking ability and analyse his/her attitude towards the company and work.
