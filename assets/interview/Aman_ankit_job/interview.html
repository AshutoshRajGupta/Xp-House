                <p>There were multiple recruitment processes within campus and also outside campus. However, the general process we had was that they have a screening test initially after verifying the set eligibility criteria. </p>
                <p>This screening test generally covers aptitude, technical and coding skills and some have basic English skills. After the screening they generally have a one on one interview where they ask questions about Networking, OS, algorithms, data structures, software development, database queries as per job requirements. Sometimes if the job requires customer interaction, then the recruitment process also includes group discussion to evaluate communication skills.</p>
                <p>Generally the HR round is the last round where they test the non technical skills and etiquettes. These generally involve a few tricky questions to judge the behaviour and emotional quotient.</p>

                    <span class="adv">Advice</span>
                    <li>Be very clear with the job description. Some big companies hire you first and then device which project you will work on later when you join. </li>
                    <li>While other companies are very clear with job description. If you are someone with interest or inclination towards a particular type of work, then be very careful in the interviews you appear.</li>
                    <li> It is also expected that you don't leave any concept related to the above mentioned topics in your syllabus in any confusion. Make sure that you are ready for the interview. </li>
                    <li>Also realise that no matter how much you learn in the college, it is just the beginning of life outside and there will be professionals who know better than you. It is important to stay firm on what you know, however be accommodating enough that there is a lot that you might not know in depth yet. Try to make the interview process a learning experience for yourself. The interviewers would likely choose a candidate with a better attitude to learn than someone who is over confident.</li>
