            <ul class="advice">
                <span class="adv">Advice</span>
                <li>You wonâ€™t get selected in the first interview itself unless youâ€™re lucky enough. So do not get demotivated. No doubt, till you sit on the process of interview you will be enough experienced in computer field, of Couse, in terms of basic knowledge. So, every company will come up with different criteria, expectation and yes CTC. Hence, what skills are required? what is the criteria? these questions will be answered by each and every company during their pre-placement talk.</li>
                <li>All you have to be is confident and motivated. Just because other person or the entire class have been placed doesnâ€™t mean you are not qualified enough; you just need to clear up your basics and have confidence in yourself in whatever you do. That particular period is loaded with stress, because you will have to pay attention to your BE major project, various minor projects, lectures, practicalâ€™s, interview preparations and many more, all at the same time. </li>
                <li> My only advice is to not panic if you do not get selected even after working very hard. Do not stress. Do not get demotivated. Instead reach out to those who are selected and ask them what was asked and what answers they gave and prepare accordingly. </li>
                <li>You have enough knowledge to clear up an interview. Just be confident and motivated. Everything will fall in place at its own right time. Have patience.</li>
